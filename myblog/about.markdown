I am an experienced engineering manager and software development professional with a diverse career spanning innovative technologies and industries. From advancing VOIP communication systems for air traffic control to designing wireless surgical tool identification systems, I thrive on solving complex challenges that merge technical ingenuity with impactful business outcomes.

My professional journey has led me to roles that range from department director to hands-on developer, equipping me with a comprehensive understanding of business operations and technical leadership. Notable achievements include expanding device testing and verification capacity by over 400%, automating systems to prevent failures in high-stakes environments, and implementing strategies that increased department revenue by over 15%.

I’m passionate about leveraging technology to drive efficiency and value, fostering collaborative environments, and empowering teams to exceed expectations. Let’s connect to explore innovative solutions and share ideas that make a difference.

### Our Great Leaders Exploration

Experiencing great leadership can be rare for many in their professional experience. This exploration would attempt to find those that demonstrate great leadership, what traits and habbits lead to that, and how we can build great work environments to foster this development.

## Aiding

These are projects I am a contributing member for, but not leading myself.
