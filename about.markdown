## Exploring

These are projects I am working on, or planning to. If you would like to work together on them, please feel free to reachout out and let me know!

### Our Great Leaders Exploration

Experiencing great leadership can be rare for many in their professional experience. This exploration would attempt to find those that demonstrate great leadership, what traits and habbits lead to that, and how we can build great work environments to foster this development.

## Aiding

These are projects I am a contributing member for, but not leading myself.
